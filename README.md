Below are the acceptance criteria:

#### AC 1. Complete Shift List screen:

Build a shift list screen with shift card items. Each card shows shift start date time, end date time, role, department, location, and
net hours. Net hours are calculated by "end date time - start date time".

#### AC 2. Complete Shift Details screen.

By clicking on a shift card item, navigate to the shift details screen. The details screen shows shift start date time, end date time,
role,
department, location, and net hours.

#### AC 3. Use Different API Keys for Developer and Production Environments.

The request token should be passed according to the environments. Please create two build types: dev and prod that use different
request tokens. In this practice, it is okay to use the same token for both environments.
